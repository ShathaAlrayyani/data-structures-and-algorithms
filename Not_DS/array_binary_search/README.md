# Binary Search of Sorted Array
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters:
a sorted array and the search key.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods
available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s
element that is equal to the value of the search key,
or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O --> time complexity and space :

Best case : O(1)

Average case : O(log n)

worse case : O(log n)

 An algorithm whose in best case performance will grow linearly 
and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.
